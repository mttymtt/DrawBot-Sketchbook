A SELECTION OF HEXANDRIAN PLANTS, BELONGING TO THE NATURAL ORDERS AMARYLLIDÆ AND LILIACÆ, FROM DRAWINGS BY MRS. EDWARD BURY, LIVERPOOL

1834

This digital collection of thousands of page images of well-known and esoteric illustrated botanical plate books is inspired by an exhibition and subsequent monograph, Nature Illustrated: Flowers, Plants, and Trees, 1550-1900 (1989), by Bernard McTigue, the late former Curator of the Arents Collection and Keeper of Rare Books.
